## Original Text (Processed by ChatGPT)

1. We turn now to those fast-growing wildfires in Canada, forcing thousands to evacuate their homes.

2. More than 140 active fires, the majority raging across British Columbia and Alberta, causing poor air quality and reducing visibility.

3. And that smoke is already impacting air quality in North Dakota, Minnesota, and other parts of the US. Here's ABC's Jaclyn Lee tonight.

4. Firefighters are racing against the clock to contain wildfires that are consuming parts of Canada. In Northern British Columbia, thousands of residents in multiple communities are evacuating.

5. Ninety percent of the country's active fires are in British Columbia and Alberta. Thick smoke in Edmonton, Alberta's Capital City, home to nearly 1 million people.

6. The smoke from those fires is now making its way across the border and into the Upper Midwest. The entire state of Minnesota and much of Wisconsin are under an air quality alert for unhealthy air through tomorrow.

7. Last summer, much of the US impacted by smoke from the fires burning throughout Canada. The New York City skyline turning orange amid the hazardous air quality.

8. Canada is coming off its worst wildfire season on record. The current widespread drought is not helping anything, with the potential for another rough wildfire year ahead.
