1. But in other news today, an earthquake has struck in Taiwan. Sally has the details of that morning.

2. Morning, thank you very much Steven. Yes, at least four people are dead, and dozens are injured after a 7.4 magnitude quake struck Taiwan. Seismologists say the earthquake is the strongest to hit the East Asian nation in 25 years.

3. Our Asia correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, is in the capital Taipei for us this morning. Morning Rupert, what more do we know about the impact of this earthquake?

4. Well, it struck right across the east coast of the island and has unleashed a lot of damage. The most dramatic things we've seen so far are pictures of very large landslides.

5. The east coast of Taiwan is far more dramatic than the west coast, rugged and mountainous, and there are narrow valleys and high, craggy mountains over 12,000 ft high, and a lot of them go right down into the ocean.

6. What this earthquake is done this very very powerful shake this morning is it has unleashed very large landslides, coming down into the ocean, into valleys. They're cutting off valleys, cutting roads, clearing away bridges, so it's really a messy situation over there.

7. The main city in the east of the island, Hualian, which is quite a small city and it's a quite remote area, was struck, and there has been damaged there. We've seen two large buildings have partially collapsed. But I have to say, given the strength of this earthquake - 7.4 and very very strong shaking, mercifully the damage to the urban infrastructure has so far been relatively light.

8. Rupert, I know earlier there had been concerns about tsunamis. What's the latest on that?"

9. That's right. The Japenese authorities, because Japan's southern islands are very close to Taiwan, they put up a tsunami warning this morning immediately after the earthquake. We have seen some very very small tsunami about 30 centimeter, but still water rushing into a fishing port off the east coast here and rushing out again. But nothing on the scale that would cause major damage, and fortunately, those tsunami warnings have now been lifted.

10. Rupert Wingfield Hayes in Taipei, thank you very much indeed.
