## Original Text (Processed by ChatGPT)

1. Faculty at St Mary's University in Halifax are calling for the resignation of the president and the chair of the Board of Governors. The union that represents nearly 300 staff members voted overwhelmingly in support of a no-confidence motion.

2. Brett Rusin is live with us this morning, and he has the details on what is happening behind this groundswell of opposition and this vote. Brett, what's going on?

3. Yeah, Heather, this is just the latest move by the union representing the faculty at St Mary's University, the third-largest university by enrollment in Nova Scotia behind Dalhousie and Cape Breton University.

4. And you can tell that faculty members aren't happy with the way things are being run. 91% of the faculty voting to that they don't have confidence in those two members of leadership that you mentioned. Now, what does this vote mean?

5. Nothing automatically in the immediate schedule or timeline. There's noting binding. There's nothing enforceable about this. The vote is taking and taken by the union internally.

6. But it does show the lack of confidence that the faculty has in the management of the University. Debt is up, enrollment is down, which is in contrast to other universities that are either doing fairly well or even on the upswing in some cases.

7. As for university's side of things, they say that they're hearing the thoughts and the voices and the opinions of the union representing the faculty. They want to work closely with the union and with faculty members, work amicably to ensure that the university continues to be sustainable in the future.

8. As for next steps, the union says that they plan to have an information meeting just outside of the university just on one of the main busy street corners that the university is situated on in the south end of Halifax. That will happen tomorrow afternoon. Open to faculty members as well as to members of the general public to learn more about the situation. At SMU, Heather.
