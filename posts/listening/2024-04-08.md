1. President Biden is set to announce a new student debt relief plan that will impact millions of Americans if it goes into effect. Supreme Court struck down a previous plan. Chief White House correspondent Mary Bruce has the details. Good morning, Mary.

2. Good morning, George. Well, during a trip to the key battleground state of Wisconsin today, President Biden will unveil his new sweeping student loan plan, which could erase or lower debt for tens of millions of Americans.

3. So here is what we can expect: The plan targets runaway interest, canceling up to $20,000 for the 25 million borrowers who now owe more than they borrowed. Those making $120,000 or less a year would be eligible to have all of their interest wiped out. The plan would also eliminate debt for borrowers with at least 20-year-old loans.

4. Now, the rollout of this is set to begin this fall, and the White House says that combined with its previous efforts, this means that more than 30 million Americans could see relief.

5. Is this the president's most significant attempt to address this since the Supreme Court struck down his plan last year? But, guys, it comes as the president is eager to show voters he can make good on this pledge as we head into the November election.
