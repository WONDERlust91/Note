1. Next tonight, as we reach the end of the school year, school districts are bracing for a massive round of teacher layoffs.

2. Schools have already been dealing with declining enrollment and inflation, but now federal funding passed during the pandemic is set to expire. Here's ABC's Morgan Norwood.

3. Tonight, school districts from coast to coast (are) bracing for possible teacher layoffs. Tensions (are) running high in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with dozens rallying against the school board's decision to cut teachers.

4. "Say, when will we know if this is going to happen and do it directly and clearly so I can go to sleep tonight?"

5. In Hamburg, New York, district leaders approved a budget that includes layoffs for 20 employees, including 13 teachers.

6. "The last thing in the world we want to do is lay off a single teacher, a single mechanic, or custodian or teacher aide. We need to make sure that our revenues, our enrollment, our staffing are all in balance. This budget does that."

7. And in Los Angeles, America's second-largest school district, mounting concern for what budget cuts could mean for the city's teachers and students. "It's unfortunate and disappointing.".

8. A critical factor in some of these budget battles: $190 billion in federal pandemic relief funding approved in 2020 and 2021 that some districts used to bolster their staff. Now, set up to dry this September.

9. The federal funding is coming to an end this fall. Another reason is increasing inflation costs and costs of things like health care and education, and another reason is declining student enrollments in our K-12 public school systems. So, this kind of combination of factors has really created the perfect storm.

10. And Rachel, experts say students in lower-income districts could feel the brunt of these layoffs. But look, this fight is far from over.

11. The National Education Association, the country's largest labor union, is demanding that federal, state, and local leaders come up with a solution that serves both educators and their students. Rachel.

12. A lot of concern over this. Morgan, thank you.
