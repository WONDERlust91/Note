4. The dogs belong to the person living in the home where the boy was visiting. Both dogs have been seized by Animal Control. Its officers have already responded to two attack complaints at the home this year. One complaint is still under investigation, but the other was settled without charges laid.

5. "My son walks to school and from school, so that's concerning that, you know, not even just their dog, but any animal attack could happen now. It's in my mind."

7. "What a devastating thing to take place."

8. Liza Sunley doesn't know the details of the attack, but as CEO of Edmonton Humane Society, she says there're things for dog owners to watch for - to try to preventing attacks.

9. "It's very important that owners know their dog, they have them trained, and that anyone who's interacting with animals has some level of awareness of how to read body language or is there with the owner who can help to interpret that. So if a dog is fearful or begins to be aggressive, we can stop that behavior, separate the person from the dog."

10. The two dogs are currently at the animal control center under the Dangerous Dogs Act. A judge can rule dogs to be put down if they bite or threaten to bite a person.
