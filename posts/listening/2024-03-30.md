## Original Text (Processed by ChatGPT)

1. Another round of brutal weather slamming the West Coast this weekend. Brittnany Bell from our New York station WABC is in for Somara. Hey there, Britney, good morning to you.

2. Hey, Jaina, and good morning to you too. As well, Just a wet and messy weekend shaping up for most of California. This was the scene in Santa Rosa just north of San Francisco yesterday with those raindrops coming down. More is on the way, all thanks to this large coastal storm.

3. That dye of south, prompting all of these flood alerts. I want to point out this flood warning for Los Angeles, saying that landslides are likely. And with that flood watch, up to 1 to 3 inches of rain is possible. Locally, up to 6 inches of rain could come down. So this is why.

4. Let's look at the timing. The steadiest rain will fall throughout this morning. Showers will turn more scattered as we head into this afternoon and this evening, will still very wet, and messy wet weather continues into early tomorrow morning.

5. We talked about the rainfall totals. Let's switch over to snow over the next 5 days for the higher elevations. As that moves off to the east, 6 to 12 inches of snow are possible, and up to one to two feet for parts of this here in Nevada. Trevor.

All right, thank you, Brittnany.
