1. If you've been feeling some seasonal sniffles already or find yourself reaching for a tissue or eye drops, you're not alone. Warmer winters are leading to earlier springs, and that means earlier allergy seasons. Tashauna Reid has more.

2. It's that time of year - spring is in bloom, and so are seasonal allergies. And with a milder winter in some parts of the country, it meant some Canadians experienced seasonal allergies much earlier this year.

3. In BC, seasonal allergies started at the end of January.

4. "I get allergy shots, and to that like every single week. It's just some runny noses and some stuffy noses and itchy eyes and itchy of my palates."

5. Scientists at this lab in Ottawa track pollen and fungal spores. They collect daily air samples from 30 stations across Canada, and over the last three decades, they've seen a shift.

6. "What we've see in Canada over the last 10-15 years is definitely an increase in overall pollen levels, as well as concentration, as well as duration of season."

7. Their data shows the pollen season to be about 2 to 3 weeks longer in Canada, starting earlier and ending later in the year. And some researchers say climate change is to blame. Pollen thrives in warm temperatures, and with more carbon dioxide in the air, it can lead to higher pollen concentrations.

8. "About 20 to 25% of the Canadian population does have environmental allergies. We can definitely say that as the pollen counts are higher and the seasons are longer, more people will notice their allergies."

9. The biggest culprits? Tree pollen in the spring, grass in the summer, and ragweed heading into the fall. Allergists say it's likely we will continue to experience longer and intense allergy seasons, and for people who deal with it, they'll need to find ways to lessen the impacts.

10. That can mean seeking relief through over-the-counter medications or prescriptions, or limiting your exposure to pollen, from closing windows to wearing sunglasses and showering after being outside.
