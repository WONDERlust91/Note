A minute of silence has been held in Prague to remember the victims of Thursday's mass shooting. The Czech Republic is holding a day of national mourning for those killed in the attack, with flags flown at half-mast. Fourteen people were shot dead at Charles University by a student who then killed himself. It's one of the deadliest attacks by a lone gunman in Europe this century. Police are still trying to establish a motive. Our correspondent, Bethany Bell, is in Prague.

Flags are flying at half-mast across the country as a sign of respect for the people who died in the shooting at Charles University. People are also thinking about those who were injured, with a number of them still in hospital, some in a serious condition. This is an attack that has deeply shocked the country. The police are still investigating, trying to establish what drove this 24-year-old gunman to do what he did. They say that there now appears to be a link between the gunman and two more deaths that took place last week.

Two bodies were discovered in a Prague forest, a young man and his two-month-old daughter. Police now say that there seems to be ballistic evidence linking those deaths with this gunman. This is an extremely sad Christmas for the whole country, and people here are still very much in shock.
