# IELTS Listening

## Basic information, tips

Know the test:

- about 30 minutes
- extra 2 minutes at the end
- 40 questions
- 4 sections of 10 questions
- answers are always in order
- only 3 main types of question (gap-fill, multiple choice, matching)
- various English accents

You only hear the recordings once!

Do some real practice tests

Tips:

1. Read **ahead** (only check back at the end)
2. Underline keywords
3. Listen for keywords **or synonyms**
4. Be careful with spelling
5. Don't get stuck on a difficult question - move forward
6. Concentrate!

## Section 1

- two speakers
- an 'everyday' conversation e.g. making a booking
- one speaker gives basic information
- simple gap-fill: missing details
- names, addresses, dates, times, numbers
- section 1 is easy, but you need a high score (9 or 10 correct)

Key technique:

Use the breaks to read ahead

- before each section starts
- in the **middle** of each section (except in section 4)
- at the **end** of each section

Don't check back, read **ahead**

## Section 2

- use all of the break time at the end of section 1
- one speaker only
- a short speech about a non-academic topic e.g. tourism, a park, local facilities
- gap-fill, multiple choice, matching
- break in the middle
- still quite easy, aim for a high score

## Section 3

- use breaks to read and **underline**
- two or three speakers
- conversation related to education or training e.g. tutor and student
- gap-fill, multiple choice (difficult)
- underline keywords in questions and choices
- listen for keywords **or synonyms**
- difficult section, aim for 6 or 7

## Section 4

- use break at the end of section 3
- underline keywords
- **no** break in the middle!
- one speaker only
- speech about an academic topic
- gap-fill, multiple choice
- listen for keywords **or synonyms**
- difficult: faster speech, more content, extra information
