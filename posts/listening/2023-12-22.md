I didn't want to leave my home; we were comfortable. But the houses opposite were being bombed, one after another. I knew our turn would come next. Jihad and his family headed for the Salah alen road, which links North and South Gaza. In the rush to go, we didn't even close our front door. Then we started our journey through hell. We walked for hours, and you eventually would have to cross the Israeli Army's checkpoint.

The checkpoint can be seen here on satellite images taken the following day. We spent more than 4 hours waiting. My father fainted, and we had to hold him up. When we entered the checkpoint, it felt like Judgment Day. Jihad's family crossed the checkpoint safely. A few meters beyond the checkpoint, I saw four detainees in their underwear being blindfolded beside a demolished building. There was a wall of sand. The blindfolded men were taken to the sandhill by soldiers and then took steps down out of my vision. Then we heard gunfire. I'm not sure whether they were shot or not.
