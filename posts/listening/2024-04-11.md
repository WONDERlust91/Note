## Original Text (Processed by ChatGPT)

1. How much aid is actually getting into Gaza? Some aid is being dropped from planes, but most comes over land. The UN says at least 500 aid lorries are required daily for the people of Gaza, particularly those in the north where they say 70% face catastrophic hunger.

2. The Israeli Army says more than 400 lorries entered Gaza on Monday. The UN said it was less than 250. So why are these numbers so different? It's all about how they're counted.

3. The UN says Israel counts the number of lorries at the Gaza border. But the truck are typically only allowed to be half full. A UN spokes person said that's a requirement put in place for screening purposes by the Israelis. The lorry then across into Gaza, and are unloaded and are reloaded onto different trucks.

4. The UN says these repacked lorries are allowed to be full, and it's these ones that drive onto warehouses that are counted by the UN. That's why the number arriving there is often far lower than the number screened by the Israelis.

5. Israel denies hindering humanitarian relief into Gaza. We've asked them if they only screen half-full lorries and why, but they haven't responded to that.
