## Original Text (Processed by ChatGPT)

1. We've all seen numerous articles and studies claiming the benefits of step count with rather different figures, so what is the truth behind walking and health? How many daily steps should we be doing?

2. We should think of studies not as the latest study is the best, but we should think of studies as pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. They all say something, but you need to put them all together and look at them in totality.

3. I believe that the totality of evidence indicates two important things. First, that any stepping is good. And second, the more you do, the better you are. up to a certain point.

4. This certain point may differ according to your age. Among individuals who are younger than 60 years of age, the point of maximum benefit appears to be somewhere between 8 and 10,000 steps a day. Among those 60 and older, the point of maximum benefit appears to be somewhere between 6 and 8,000 steps a day.

5. If you prefer and choose to do a high-intensity workout in the gym, that will take you less time. If you prefer to walk, it will take you a longer time to offset the potential harm from sedentary activity.

6. Being sedentary and physically active are not flip sides of the coin because one can be very active and one can be very sedentary. So people who have desk jobs like me probably are very sedentary most of their work time, but we can also be active outside of work time, so we have both characteristics.

7. You could possibly stand while you're thinking every half an hour or so, but it's also useful to take a short walk. And it doesn't have to be a walk around the block. You can simply walk up and down the corridor, go up and down the stairs if you have stairs at home, or do some jumping jacks. Physical activity is something that is so crucial for health. What drug do you know when taken can benefit so many health outcomes with so little side effect?
