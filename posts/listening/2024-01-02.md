The powerful earthquake in Japan, at least several people killed, tens of thousands without electricity, and now in the bitter cold. The magnitude 7.5 quake hitting just hours into the new year. Homes collapsing in clouds of dust, the largest quake to hit this part of Japan in nearly 140 years. Here's ABC's Maggie Ry tonight.

Japan is on alert after a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake rocked the country, triggering fears of tsunamis along the coast. This video taken inside a convenience store in Nagano showing items on shelves shaking violently. Customers inside rushing out to safety. Cell phone video taken from inside the store showing the panic and chaos, customers running for cover.

The powerful tremors rocking this home near the epicenter. You can hear a child crying in terror. "Just started very slowly and then it was just a violent shake," the series of quakes cutting through roads triggering landslides and reducing dozens of homes to rubble. Bullet trains in the region suspended, flights in and out of the nearest airport cancelled. Along the coast, thousands of buildings have lost power, including hospitals. This footage showing utility poles and electrical wires swaying, threatening to come crashing down.

4:00 p.m. Monday, the quake hitting the Noto Peninsula along the Sea of Japan, the most powerful in the region since records began in 1885. Officials immediately issuing a major tsunami warning, fearing waves could be 16 ft high. Tens of thousands along the coast forced to evacuate to higher ground. At least four people have died. Now the race to rescue survivors is underway, thousands of military personnel on standby for fears people could be trapped.

And Mary, no major tsunamis have been reported, and authorities have downgraded the warning. But already more than a hundred aftershocks have been reported, and the fear is that more are expected. Mary, that certainly is the fear. Maggie, thank you.
