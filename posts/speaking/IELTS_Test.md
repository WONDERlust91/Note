## Speaking

person - friend

I want to talk about my friend Jun. In terms of appearance, he is of medium height, has somewhat dark skin, well-defined facial features, and single eyelids. Despite that, he is very handsome and has a typical Asian look. Personality-wise, he is outgoing, carefree, generous, and loves making friends, which makes him a very easy-going person. We met during college, and we’ve been friends for over ten years now. He is very smart and can achieve excellent grades effortlessly. He also loves sports, excelling at ping-pong, badminton, and tennis. At the same time, he is a very courageous person who dares to try new things and is unafraid of making mistakes. I was once deeply moved by a story he told me. The story was called "Throwing the Hat Over the Wall." In the story, two people are blocked by a wall. One hesitates whether to take a detour or make the effort to climb over, while the other person throws his hat over the wall, forcing himself to climb over. This story has stayed with me ever since. Even though we haven't seen each other for a long time, we often stay in touch and chat on WeChat.

event - concert

The most unforgettable concert I attended was the piano concert on June 18th, held at the Xinghai Concert Hall in Guangzhou, performed by the renowned pianist Oskar Roman Jezior. I first discovered Oskar on the app Bilibili (which is similar to YouTube), where fans affectionately call him "Uncle O." His extraordinary piano skills and unique adaptations of songs deeply moved me. When I found out he was coming to China for a concert, I bought a ticket almost immediately.

This performance was truly special because Oskar didn’t perform traditional Western classical pieces but instead adapted popular Chinese songs and Japanese anime theme music. His repertoire included JJ Lin's "She Says," F.I.R's "Our Love," Eason Chan’s "Under Mount Fuji," the theme song from the TV drama Someday or One Day, and Joe Hisaishi's "Summer".

His unique interpretations breathed new life into each piece. Some amplified the emotions of the original songs, while others expressed more delicate feelings. In fact, some adaptations conveyed entirely different emotions from the original pieces, yet they were just as beautiful and moving.

At the end, amid thunderous applause from the audience, Oskar took multiple bows and returned to the stage several times. He invited everyone to turn on their phone flashlights and take a photo with him in the concert hall, marking the end of this memorable concert.

place - trip

The most memorable trip I ever took was to Sanya, a city located in Hainan Province, almost at the southernmost point of China. It was a road trip, and I traveled with my mom, my aunt’s family, and my grandma. We drove for five days from Xi’an to Zhanjiang, then took a ferry with our car to Haikou City on Hainan Island, and from there, we drove to Sanya. In Sanya, we rented a place by the beach. The complex had an outdoor swimming pool, and just across the street was the beach and the sea. It was unimaginable how wonderful it felt to freely swim between the pool and the sea.

In evening, after getting out of the water, we would drive to the First Market in Sanya to buy various seafood, and we’d make a big, delicious dinner. It was a truly joyful experience. However, the trip wasn’t without its downsides. The cost of living in Sanya was high, and daily expenses were quite expensive. The tropical climate was also extremely hot, and we chose to travel in the summer, which made it worse. Additionally, the seawater was salty and bitter, and it was quite unpleasant when you accidentally swallowed some.

Overall, we spent two leisurely weeks in Sanya, and it was much more enjoyable than the rushed, check-off-the-sights style of travel that comes with group tours.
