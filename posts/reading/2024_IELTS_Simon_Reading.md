3. Fill the gaps with words from a list / box
4. Fill the gaps in a table

You can normally find the answers **IN ORDER** in the passage

Keyword Table:

| Keywords in questions    | Similar words in the passage     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| inside                   | containing                       |
| shaded                   | shady                            |
| moist                    | damp                             |
| not classed as parasites | never parasitic                  |

| special qualities        | sense of calm, age and stillness |

## True, False, Not Given, Yes, No, Not Given

Is there a difference between the following?

- True, False, Not given

  when the passage is about facts

- Yes, No, Not given

  when the passage is about the writer's views

Tips: These differences are not important! We can approach both question types in the same way. Just think: correct, incorrect, not given.

Remember:

True / Yes - the correct information is given

False / No - different information is given, contradicting the statement

Not given - we don't know the answer there isn't enough information

Find the 'keywords' and then compare the question and passage carefully

Answers are **always in the correct order** in the passage

Keyword Table:

| Keywords in questions | Similar words in the passage       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

## Matching paragraph headings

'Paragraph headings' questions are difficult...

because the answers are **not in order** in the passage and because some of the headings may be similar

Techniques:

   - Do all other questions for that passage first
   - You will then be more familiar with the passage
   - You might get some of the answers from memory
2. Underline 'keywords' in each heading on the list
3. Then read the shortest or easiest paragraph
   - Read at normal speed
   - Underline the main ideas in the paragraph
   - Compare with all of the headings
   - Choose the best one

## Which paragraph contains?

- List of statements
- Find which paragraph contains the information in each statement

'Which paragraph contains' questions are difficult...

- because the answers are **not in order** in the passage
- the same paragraph may contain more than one answer
- some of the paragraphs may not contain any answers

Techniques:

1. Do 'which paragraph contains' questions last
   - Do all other questions for that passage first
   - You will then be more familiar with the passage
   - You might get some of the answers from memory
2. Underline 'keywords' in each statement
3. Then start with the easiest statement
   - Information that you remember reading about
   - Easy keywords that you can **scan** for

## Multiple choice questions

Multiple choice questions can be difficult because there is a lot to read, and the choices can be similar and confusing.

You can normally find the answers **in order** in the passage

Vocabulary:

coined = first used (to coin a phrase or term)

post-war = after the war

the allure = the attraction

source countries = countries that people are leaving

host countries = countries where migrants are going

a remittance = money sent as payment or as a gift

initiatives = schemes

## Matching names

- A list of question statements
- A box containing a list of names

'Matching names' sections can be difficult because...

- the answers are **not in order** in the passage
- one name may be used for **more than one answer** (if it matches more than one of the statements)
- some of the **names may not be needed**

Techniques:

1. Underline 'keywords' in each **statement**
2. Scan the passage to find all of the **names**
   - Highlight each name clearly (e.g. circle them)
3. Choose the **name** with the shortest description
   - read the sentences around that name
   - underline the main ideas relating to that name
4. Compare with **all** of the question **statements**
   - go through the question statements to see if any of them match what you read

Keyword Table:

| Keywords in questions                   | Similar words in the passage |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
