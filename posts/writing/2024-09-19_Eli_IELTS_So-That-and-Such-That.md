## 题目

It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and going university. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?

gap year

好处：发掘喜欢的事、探索；挣钱；工作经验
坏处：浪费学业时间；毕业晚，影响职业规划

The debate on having a gap year between finishing school and going university has captured headlines in newspapers, stirred debate on social media, and has been at the forefront on the topics of people's minds. Although some students are still making the bet that taking a gap year could lead to many disadvantages to them, I am a firm believer in the countless advantages offered by having a year off before going to university.

What this new concept of taking a gap year has fostered is an erroneous perspective that spending a whole year in traveling or working could gain some momentum in academic learning in universities. First, now is the time to acknowledge that having a great and fruitful academic experience in any university needs a large amount of time, which taking a year off happens to waste inefficiently for many students. Second, we are all fully convinced that a successful professional career in any industry equals the number of efforts made by a person, which then translates into the amount of time the person invests in his job, which taking a gap year will play a role in preventing him from acquiring.

There is no end of enthusiasm, however, from some students to spend a year off for several reasons. To begin with, the rising insight that during a gap year, it is easier and more effective to explore new things and decide what to major in university for many students has recently gathered momentum around the world, which could let someone avoid choosing the majors they have no interest in. In addition, taking a gap year could no doubt relieve some students' financial pressure for various university costs. Taking a gap year in having a prefessional job is extremely reasonable and sensible for some students that most of diverse living and academic costs, such as dormitory fees, tuition, and other living expenses, could be covered without the help of their parents.
