# 倒装句

## 主谓宾 4 种形式

I love you. (v.)

I am a boy. (be + n.)

I am happy. (be + adj.)

I am in school. (be + prep.)

## 为什么倒装

1. 宾语相对主语更加重要

2. 主语加定语从句太长，谓语宾语太短

## 完全倒装

介词/形容词不能作主语，且 be 动词单三是根据后面真正的主语

Among others is he.

Among others are many students.

More important in my books are my pages.

## 部分倒装

否定副词（not, seldom, little, hardly, never, rarely, nowhere, only） = not

否定副词提前，主谓倒装，谓语有助动词的，仅主语和助动词倒装

He can hardly play soccer.

Hardly can he play soccer.

## so/neither/nor 倒装（表示“也”）

I can learn math in our school with a computer.

其他同学几年前也可以

So can other students several years ago. (情态动词没有过去式)

## As 倒装（表示“尽管”）

As he is a child, he speaks fluent English.

倒装：A child as he is, he speaks fluent English.

As she is important, she can not do that.

倒装：Important as she is, she can not do that.

As he has a book, he did not read it.

倒装：A book as he has, he did not read it.
