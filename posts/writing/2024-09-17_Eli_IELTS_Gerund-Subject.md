## 题目

Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?

早生孩子：

1. 母亲身体好
2. 以后会有更多时间工作
3. 代沟

晚生孩子：

1. 经济教育资源更多
2. 生活质量更好
3. 事业更稳定

Nowadays, giving birth to a child in later life has become a increasingly common trend in our society. Although there definetely could be a bright side to having a child when coupled with certain conditions in early life, making such an important decision at a later life stage, from my perspective, should be welcomed for many reasons as follows.

On the one hand, it's worth bearing in mind that having a kid at early life could offer a host of decent benefits to adults. First, it has been thoroughly proved in countless medical research that younger mothers are less likely to suffer from some physical diseases and complication（并发症） related to giving birth and the process of delivery. Second, spending a lot of time with kids at an young age could make it easier for parents to better accept the role of being a guardian emotionally and mentally, because there is a smaller age gap between parents and children.

On the other hand, the rapid advances in medical and biological fields could bring unimagined merits/advantages to people having decided to have children later in their life. To begin with, a combination of more time to build a stable job career, more experience in dealing with emotional conversations, and more financial support to afford a high-quality life could render a large majority of new parents provide a wonderful family environment for their children. In addition, if there is more time for young parents to make informed and well-considered decisions to have a baby, which probably means that the decision will be contemplated to become more mature, the goal of having a happy family with kids will not out of reach.

To sum up, whether there are more advantages in having children in early life or later life remains to be seen. I firmly hold, however, that drawbacks of being a parent at a young age outweigh the merits of having a baby at more mature life stage.
