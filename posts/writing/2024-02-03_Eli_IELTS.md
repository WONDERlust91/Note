## 写作总体方向

作文提升次序，按下表，由上到下，达到一个层次，再考虑下个层次，切忌直接去提升词汇句型

| 作文      | 提高                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 主题/细节 | 不要跑题（读错题）字数 正式的 tone |
| 语法      | 不要有任何语法错误                 |
| 词汇句型  | 达到一定程度才考虑                 |

一定要写前列题纲：两个观点就写两段 第一段: Reason1 Reason2; 第二段：Reason1 Reason 2

图表题的描述，一定要先把数据信息分类，再描述

## 知识点

- showcase = show/demonstrate/illustrate/display

- respectively 分别的（永远后置）

- 三大补充逻辑

  1. 任何动词都可以加副词

  2. 任何名词都可以加形容词

  3. 任何句子都可以加介词（作状语）

- 否定副词提前，后面的句子主谓倒装，如果有助动词/情态动词，只需要提前情态动词

- so adj./adv. that 完整句子

- 主语 + 定语（形容词、定语从句、非谓语动词、介词短语）+ 谓语 + 宾语

## 小作文

If there is an industry that is growing extremely/unbelievably in the last decade in our society, it is definitely the traveling sector/industry that has experiece a boom for its demand. While some people argue that being a tourist in a tough environment will have numerous benefits, other people hold that there will be countless drawbacks in terms of traveling to this kind of places. In this article, the benefits and disadvantages/negatives/problems/shortcomings/downsides will be discussed/demonstrated/showcased in the following paragraphs.

On one hand, it is doubtless that traveling to a place with unknown conditions actually can provide some meaningful rewards. First, various and colorful cultures of different countries and areas can be learned/absorbed/gained （补充逻辑 1） effectively and efficiently, which will make （补充逻辑 2） diverse tourists experience unique persperctive and insights and then bring them back to their own country （补充逻辑 3） for the benefit of other people. Second/moreover/in addition, not only can people in these remote areas gain tremendous insights, but also tourists going to places where conditions are difficult will have more opportunities to build a lasting and meaningful relationship with the people they meet on the way during their trip, which could become the most valuable treasure in their life.

On the other hand, there is no doubt that planning a trip to some desolate/deserted/distant areas/regions/destinations/spots/zone will cause some troubles. To begin with, some desolate regions are so dangerous and risky that these areas could pose a great number of/countless/plenty of/numerous/a series of hazardous events to anyone who is new there. For example, in some rainforests in Brazil, which have become a hot traveling destination for more people nowadays, certain harmful and toxic plants could unexpectedly attack people to cause deadly injuries. Moreover, in terms of visiting some remote areas, there have alreaday been a lot of stories where language barriers between native people and tourists have caused serious troubles for the communication in the traveling period, which has negatively affected their traveling experience.

In conclusion, although some people believe that visiting remote and tough areas could lead to a plethora of risky and negative problems, I am fully convinced that benefits and advantages will abound during anyone's trip to some unknown but unique places.
