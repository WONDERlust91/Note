# Academic Task 1

## Remember

1. Describe what you see. Write a report. **Don't give opinions.**

2. No conclusion. Instead write a summary(the overview).

## Question Types

1. Line graph
2. Bar chart
3. Pie chart
4. Table
5. Diagram - comparing
6. Diagram - process

Type 1 - 4 are all about **numbers**.

- describe
- compare
- changes/trends

## Essay Structure

4 paragraphs:

1. Introduction - 1 sentence: Paraphrase the question
2. Overview - 2 sentences: The main, general things
3. Detail
4. Detail

Why 2 paragraphs for detail?

This makes you organise or 'group' the information better.

## Line graph

Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.

You will not see a graph with only one line. You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4, or 5 lines. Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

First, make a very general comparison. (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare the lines at specific points. (details paragraph)

You can't describe everything. Write at least one thing about each line.

Important tip when describing numbers:

    You can't write:

        - Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
        - Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

    You must write:

        - Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
        - Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

Vocabulary:

    - amount of electricity produced
    - source of / provided / generating
    - means of electricity generation
    - over a period of / over the period shown
    - by far the most important
    - a negligible amount
    - nuclear power overtook thermal power
    - as the primary source of electricity
    - rose dramatically to a peak of
    - by contrast
    - the figure for
    - remained at this level / remained stable
    - saw only a small rise

## Bar chart

Bar charts **can** show numbers changing over a period of time.

However! Bar charts don't always show time... They often only compare numbers.

First, make a very general comparison. (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare specific numbers. (details paragraphs)

Vocabulary:

    - sold worldwide
    - sales figures, purchase
    - most popular, best selling brand, top selling
    - second most successful manufacturer
    - market leader
    - mobile phones, handsets, units
