# Academic Task 1

## Remember

1. Describe what you see. Write a report. **Don't give opinions.**

2. No conclusion. Instead write a summary(the overview).

## Question Types

1. Line graph
2. Bar chart
3. Pie chart
4. Table
5. Diagram - comparing
6. Diagram - process

Type 1 - 4 are all about **numbers**.

- describe
- compare
- changes/trends

## Essay Structure

4 paragraphs:

1. Introduction - 1 sentence: Paraphrase the question
2. Overview - 2 sentences: The main, general things
3. Detail
4. Detail

Why 2 paragraphs for detail?

This makes you organise or 'group' the information better.

## Line graph

Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.

You will not see a graph with only one line. You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4, or 5 lines. Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

First, make a very general comparison. (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare the lines at specific points. (details paragraph)

You can't describe everything. Write at least one thing about each line.

Important tip when describing numbers:

    You can't write:

        - Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
        - Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

    You must write:

        - Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
        - Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

Vocabulary:

    - amount of electricity produced
    - source of / provided / generating
    - means of electricity generation
    - over a period of / over the period shown
    - by far the most important
    - a negligible amount
    - nuclear power overtook thermal power
    - as the primary source of electricity
    - rose dramatically to a peak of
    - by contrast
    - the figure for
    - remained at this level / remained stable
    - saw only a small rise

## Bar chart

Bar charts **can** show numbers changing over a period of time.

However! Bar charts don't always show time... They often only compare numbers.

First, make a very general comparison. (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare specific numbers. (details paragraphs)

Vocabulary:

    - sold worldwide
    - sales figures, purchase
    - most popular, best selling brand, top selling
    - second most successful manufacturer
    - market leader
    - mobile phones, handsets, units
    - brands, manufacturers, companies, vendors
    - saw the biggest rises, saw declining sales
    - close to, almost, approximately, around
    - double the number
    - rise by a similar amount
    - respectively
    - overtook the other two vendors

## Pie chart

Pie chart **can** show numbers, but they **always** show percentages

First, make a very general comparison (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare specific figures ('detail' paragraphs)

Tips

- Don't describe each country separately
- Dont't describe each year separately
- Compare countries and years together
- Mention all 5 categories (food & drink etc.)
- Divide the categories into two groups for the two 'details' paragraphs
- The category called 'Other' is not important
- Don't write "Leisure was 34%"
- Write "Households spent 34% of their money on leisure"

Vocabulary:

- spending, expenditure, spent, costs
- proportion of spending
- percentage of household budget
- the equivalent figure for a UK home

- while, by contrast
- leisure accounted for the highest proportion
- spent half as much in relative terms
- recreation

## Table

Tables can show:

- any kind of number
- the same information as a line graph, bar chart or pie chart
- comparisons
- changes over time (increase, decrease)
- a lot of information (too much!)

A key skill is 'selecting' which information to mention

First, look for main or general features (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, describe specific numbers ('details' paragraphs)

Key skill: selecting information

You can't mention every number

Vocabulary:

- five highest ranking countries
- the world's most popular tourist destination
- earned by far the most
- revenue from tourism
- the second most visited country

- fewer visitors than in the previous year
- these figures were well over twice as high as
- amounts of tourist revenue
- despite falling number
- saw a rise, increaded, rising from, rose by

## 2 different charts

These are questions with 2 different charts, which you **can't** compare together.

Your job is to select, describe and compare the key numbers

But you don't need to compare the 2 charts together - you can describe them separately

First, look for one main feature in **each** chart (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, describe specific numbers for each chart **separately** ('details' paragraphs)

Vocabulary:

- attending courses, who took classes
- participants, attendees, students
- males and famales

- According to the bar chart,
- Looking at the age profile pie chart,
- the majority of people
- were in the minority
- To be precise,

## Diagram - process

Describing a process is completely different from describing a graph, bar chart, pie chart or table

Differences:

- no numbers
- can't compare anything
- can't describe trends (increase, decrease)

So, what can we describe?

- how many steps
- where the process begins and ends
- each step in the process

Language for process descriptions:

- 'steps' language
- passive verbs

- At the first stage in the process
- The process beegins with
- Secondly, Finally
- The second step involves
- Next, then, after that
- At the following stage

Vocabulary:

- steps / stages in the process of
- consists of four distinct stages
- it requires five steps
- raw materials, end products
- production, manufacturing
- turn used glass into new products
- at the first stage, next, then, begins with
- are mixed, is heated, can be shaped
- is sorted according to
- can be moulded to create
- are mixed -> this mixture
- collection -> the collected glass
- is melted -> the resulting molten glass

## Diagram - comparing

Comparison diagrams show:

- changes to something e.g. an old design compard to a new design
- or two alternative designs
- or even two alternative locations on a map

Your job is to compare the diagrams:

- Describe the changes
- Describe things that don't change
- Describe the differences
- Describe the similarities

Important: Think about the verb tense that you'll use

Vocabulary:

- existing plan -> current layout
- proposed plan -> plan to redesign

- under-stair storage cupboard
- a new set of winding stairs
- the installation of some kitchen furniture
