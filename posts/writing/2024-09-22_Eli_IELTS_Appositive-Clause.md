# 同位语从句 + 外刊句式积累

## 同位语从句

含义理解：同位语的本质是用来解释名词的内容（所解释的名词，以抽象名词占绝大多数，通常是“有内容”的词）。而定语从句则是修饰名词本身。

我有一个问题，这个问题很难。（定语从句）

我有一个问题，是你多大了。（同位语从句）

我非常喜欢你这个让我踢足球的想法。（同位语从句）

I like this idea that you let me play soccer.

我非常喜欢你这个想法，这个想法让我走上了踢球的道路。（定语从句）

I like this idea that lets me play soccer.

## 题目

Some people feel that the legal age at which people can marry should be at least 21. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

高于 21 好处：经济条件好、情感稳定
低于 21 好处：促进情感自由、保护年轻人婚姻需求
低于 21 的坏处：经验不足、耽误学习

第一句：

The inescapable pairing of good and bad marriage consequences from different age groups helps to account for why so many issues stir debate in our society.

Many books and articles have been written to untangle the many possible threads that lead to the various results of marriage, and often these books become best sellers, indicating that the subject of marriage and legal marriage age is important to many.

Some views from various people illustrate the extreme polarities in positions that people often take when it comes to the topic of marriage or legal marriage age.

第二句：

One of the great boons of the leagal marriage over 21 is that people could gain better financial conditions and mature mental state before marriage. And at the other end of the scale, one of this marriage age requirement's downsides is that it could limit the freedom of people's relationship or young people's emotional desire.

低于 21 不好

I feel that the legal age at which people can marry should be at least 21. Also/furthermore, the legal marriage age of under 21 is the opposite of everything that our modern society stands for. The usual idea/preference of getting married under 21 for someone has been torn up for most of the members in our society, including me.

经验不足，耽误学习

However, there is a wealth of evidence from all kinds of research in many countries that if the legal marriage age is set under 21, many young people's academic career would be negatively affected and some new marriages could be damaged due to young people's lack of marital experience.

marital adj. 婚姻的

第二段：低于 21 的坏处：经验不足，耽误学习

Although some recent experiences may suggest otherwise, the marriage age under 21 could bring some major disadvantages to our society and young adults. First, our history of human relationships has moved the experience in love and marriage into the driving seat of a happy and wonderful marriage. However, this can not be the case for young adults because they are too young to have the time and energy in building relationships. Second, it has been taken as read by so many people in our society and proved by countless real examples in the history of human beings that early marriage could have an adverse impact on young adults', especially people under 21, academic performance. For example, a college student who needs to spend large amounts of time in acquiring systematic knowledge is more likely to be distracted massively if he gets married during college.

adverse adj. 不利的、有害的
