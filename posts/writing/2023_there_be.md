Recently, I have read a really impressive story that is thought-provoking and touching. There is a man who has already immigrated to Canada nearly ten years. The man is a Chinese who owned an industry. He is very rich, but there are many differences between him and other rich man. What he really hate are the unfairness and unsafty among people in China. He can do nothing to solve that. Therefore, he immigrate to Canada. There is one thing in his memory that has hitherto been making him regret. When he was young, his father was a leader of a department in a big enterprise. But his father is not the direct leader of the vehicle department. So his father can not order a driver to do something directly. One day, neighbor's child got a severe sick. The neighbor asked his father for help. The neighbor need a car to send the sick child to hospital as soon as possible. But his father had no power to assign a task to drivers in his company directly. Hesitated for a while, his father refused the neighbor. He was young at that time, but he still felt that his father feel sorry for refusing the neighbor. To help his father, he told the neighbor, "the child looks like in a very dangerous situation. Even though the child is rescued at last, the child will be paralyzed. So you do not need to save the child". After several decades, he bacame a father. He realized that he might do something wrong. But he didn't know where the point is. After he has been living in Canada for nearly ten years, and after a ten-year affection of Canadian culture, he finally perceived what's wrong in his conduct. He found that he say something without humanity to the father. He felt regret and teared down before the lens.

Recently, I came across a profoundly moving story that left me reflecting deeply. It revolves around a Chinese man who, having immigrated to Canada almost a decade ago, once owned a prosperous business. Despite his wealth, he differed from many affluent individuals in a significant wayâ€”his abhorrence of unfairness and lack of safety prevalent in China. Frustrated by his inability to address these issues, he made the life-altering decision to immigrate to Canada.

A poignant memory haunted him, creating lasting regret. During his youth, his father, a departmental leader in a major enterprise, lacked direct authority over the vehicle department. One day, a neighbor's child fell critically ill, urgently requiring transportation to the hospital. The neighbor sought his father's help, but constrained by his position, he couldn't command a driver to assist directly. After much hesitation, his father reluctantly declined the plea. Even in his youth, the storyteller sensed his father's remorse for turning down the neighbor.

In an attempt to ease his father's guilt, the storyteller, young and naive at the time, fabricated a grim prognosis for the sick child, dissuading the neighbor from seeking immediate help. Decades later, having become a father himself, he grappled with the realization that he might have erred in his actions. However, the specific point of error eluded him.

After residing in Canada for nearly ten years and immersing himself in the culture, he finally grasped the essence of his past transgressions. The storyteller recognized the lack of humanity in his words to the distressed father and, overwhelmed with remorse, tears welled in his eyes before the lens.
