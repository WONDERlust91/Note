## 主语从句

### 思维转换

我今天踢了足球

英语思维：

1. 我今天做的事情是踢了足球

2. 今天发生的事情是我踢了足球

我觉得你的观点是对的

英语思维：

1. 你所认为的事情是我认可的

2. 认为你的观点是对的人是我

### 语法

主语本身是个句子，谓语用单数：主语从句 + 谓语（第三人称单数） + 宾语

1. That + 完整句子（主谓宾） + 谓语（第三人称单数） + 宾语

   注意要将（That + 主谓宾）看成一个整体来发出谓语，而不是从句（主谓宾）中的 主语 发出 后面的谓语

   错误： That he played soccer today is happy. 他踢足球这件事是没法等同于“开心”的

   正确： That he played soccer today makes me happy.

   e.g. That I played soccer today is true.

2. what who how where when

   1. what who 词性为 n. 做主语或宾语，是从句主体（主谓宾）的一部分

      (Who makes you happy) is also a great man. （who 作从句的主语）

      (What you do) is great. （what 作从句的宾语）

      (What is the greatest toy in the world) is XXX. （what 作从句的主语）

      注意要将括号中看成整体，判断是否能发出后面的谓语和宾语

   2. how where when whether 词性为 adv. 做状语，因此后面要接完整的句子（主谓宾），形成从句

      How you play soccer has taught me a lot. （从句 How you play soccer 中 How 做状语，you play soccer 是完整主谓宾）

      Where you learned English is in Beijing.

## 题目

Many feel that today's increasing demand for oil and gas must prompt scientists to look for new, future energy sources. Others feel we should not search for new energy sources beecause searching causes too much damage to the environment.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

4 段（300 字）

1. 主题段：背景句 + 双方观点 + 自己观点（60 字）

注意：不是所有句子都要长，肯定不能所有句子都短

It seemed that everyone took it as read that fossil fuels like oil and gas are the most crucial part of our society nowadays. Rather than holding that we must search for new energy sources in our planet, some people assert that with many possible damaging factors in terms of excavation process, the chances are high that finding new resources could adversely affect our environment. In this essay I will examine both of the ideas.

On one hand, in terms of finding new sources, some people's idea is predicated on the fact that traditional energy sources could cause gigantic damage to our planet. There is plenty of evidence showing that the usage of fossil fuels could bring about a host of problems for our air, soil and waters on earth. In addition, what could be the case for our planet in the future is that traditional resources could be used up, making human beings unable to take advantage of their machines and devices. What's more, embraced by countless people in the energy industry, their idea chimes with mine that new energy resources like electricity or solar energy could save consumers millions of dollars for its consumption, because of their various qualities.

Although we have made strides in pinpointing new sources in the last couple of decades, the excavation process has led to huge damage to our environment. For example, the refinement and purification of these new resources could cause far-reaching effects on various areas in our environment. And the utilization of some new resources like electricity has greatly to do with many batteries, which undoubtedly could leave permanent dents on our planet.

In conclusion, discovering new energy sources is never easy, and it is made even harder by dint of the fact that some new energy sources could cause adverse impacts on our environment. Because these two kinds of ideas only scratch the surface of what is going on in terms of energy industry, we actually should take a comprehensive and holistic approach to improve the employment and discovery of energy resources.
