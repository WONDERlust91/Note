# Academic Writing Task 1

Remember:

1. Describe what you see. Write a report. **Don't give opinions.**
2. No conclusion. Instead write a summary(the overview).

Question Types:

1. Line graph
2. Bar chart
3. Pie chart
4. Table
5. Diagram - comparing
6. Diagram - process

Type 1 - 4 are all about **numbers**.

- describe
- compare
- changes/trends

Essay Structure: 4 paragraphs

1. Introduction - 1 sentence: Paraphrase the question
2. Overview - 2 sentences: The main, general things
3. Detail
4. Detail

Why 2 paragraphs for detail?

This makes you organise or 'group' the information better.

## Line graph

Line graphs show numbers changing over a period of time.

You will not see a graph with only one line. You will almost definitely see 2, 3, 4, or 5 lines. Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.

First, make a very general comparison. (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare the lines at specific points. (details paragraph)

You can't describe everything. Write at least one thing about each line.

Question:

The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

Writing:

The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.

It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.

In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a ngligible amount. Just one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.

Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

Important tip when describing numbers:

You can't write:

- Nuclear was 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- Nuclear produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

You must write:

- Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
- Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.

Vocabulary:

- amount of electricity produced
- source of / provided / generating
- means of electricity generation
- over a period of / over the period shown
- by far the most important
- a negligible amount
- nuclear power overtook thermal power
- as the primary source of electricity
- rose dramatically to a peak of
- by contrast
- the figure for
- remained at this level / remained stable
- saw only a small rise

## Bar chart

Bar charts **can** show numbers changing over a period of time.

However! Bar charts don't always show time... They often only compare numbers.

First, make a very general comparison. (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare specific numbers. (details paragraphs)

Question:

The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.

Writing:

The bar chart compares the number of mobile phones sold worldwide by the five most popular manufacturers in the years 2009, 2011 and 2013.

It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the best selling brand in 2013. Samsung and Apple saw the biggest rises in sales over the 5-year period.

In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was almost double the number of handsets sold by the second most successful manufacturer, Samsung. Over the following four years, however, Nokia's sales figures fell by approximately 200 million unites, whereas Samsung saw sales rise by a similar amount. By 2013, Samsung had become the market leader with sales reaching 450 million units.

The other three top selling mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013 were LG, ZTE and Apple. In 2009, these companies sold around 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets respectively, but Apple overtook the other two vendors in 2011. In 2013, purchases of Apple handsets reached 150 million units, while LG saw declining sales and the figures for ZTE rose only slightly.

Vocabulary:

- sold worldwide
- sales figures, purchase
- most popular, best selling brand, top selling
- second most successful manufacturer
- market leader
- mobile phones, handsets, units
- brands, manufacturers, companies, vendors
- saw the biggest rises, saw declining sales
- close to, almost, approximately, around
- double the number
- rise by a similar amount
- respectively
- overtook the other two vendors

## Pie chart

Pie chart **can** show numbers, but they **always** show percentages

First, make a very general comparison (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, compare specific figures ('detail' paragraphs)

Question:

The charts below show household spending patterns in two countries between 1980 and 2008.

Writing:

The pie charts compare five categories of household expenditure in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.

It is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, UK residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand counterparts.

In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on food and drink, while the equivalent figure for a UK hone was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. By contrast, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.

Leisure activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only half as much in relative terms on recreation (17%) as UK residents (34%). In both countries, transport costs and other costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

Tips:

- Don't describe each country separately
- Dont't describe each year separately
- Compare countries and years together
- Mention all 5 categories (food & drink etc.)
- Divide the categories into two groups for the two 'details' paragraphs
- The category called 'Other' is not important
- Don't write "Leisure was 34%"
- Write "Households spent 34% of their money on leisure"

Vocabulary:

- spending, expenditure, spent, costs
- proportion of spending
- percentage of household budget
- the equivalent figure for a UK home
- fell, rose, saw an increase in
- by 2008, expenditure had fallen
- spent a significantly larger percentage
- than their New Zealand counterparts
- 29% of an average household budget went on
- while, by contrast
- leisure accounted for the highest proportion
- spent half as much in relative terms
- recreation

## Table

Tables can show:

- any kind of number
- the same information as a line graph, bar chart or pie chart
- comparisons
- changes over time (increase, decrease)
- a lot of information (too much!)

A key skill is 'selecting' which information to mention

First, look for main or general features (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, describe specific numbers ('details' paragraphs)

Key skill: selecting information

You can't mention every number

Question:

The table below shows statistics about the top five countries for international tourism in 2012 and 2013.

Writing:

The table compares the five highest ranking countries in terms of the numbers of visits and the money spent by tourists over a period of two years.

It is clear that France was the world's most popular tourist destination in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA earned by far the most revenue from tourism over the same period.

In 2012, 83 million tourists visited France, and the USA was the Second most visited country, with 66.7 million tourists. Spain and China each received just under 58million visitors, while Italy was ranked fifth with 46.4 million tourists. 2013 saw a rise of between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million fewer visitors than in the previous year.

Spending by tourists visiting the USA increased from $126.2 billion in 2012 to $139.6 billion in 2013, and these figures were well over twice as high as those for any other country. Spain received the second highest amounts of tourist revenue, rising from $56.3 billion to $60.4 billion, followed by France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, Chinese revenue from tourism rose by $1.7 billion in 2013.

## 2 different charts

These are questions with 2 different charts, which you **can't** compare together.

Your job is to select, describe and compare the key numbers

But you don't need to compare the 2 charts together - you can describe them separately

First, look for one main feature in **each** chart (summary / overview paragraph)

Second, describe specific numbers for each chart **separately** ('details' paragraphs)

Question:

The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.

Writing:

The bar chart compares the numbers of males and females who took four different evening classes in 2009, and the pie chart shows the age profile of these attendees.

It is clear that significantly more women than men attended evening classes at the education centre. We can also see that eveing courses were much more popular among older adults.

According to the bar chart, drama, painting and language courses all attracted more women than men to the education centre in 2009. Language classes had the highest number of participants overall, with 40 female and 20 male students, while painting was a popular choice among both genders, attracting 30 female and 25 male attendees. The only course with a higher number of males was sculpture, but this course was taken by a mere 15 people in total.

Looking at the age profile pie chart, we can see that the majority of people attending evening lessons were over 40 years of age. To be precise, 42% of them were aged 50 or more, and 26% were aged between 40 and 49. Younger adults were in the minority, with only 11% of students aged 20 to 29, and only 5% aged under 20.

Vocabulary:

- attending courses, who took classes
- participants, attendees, students
- males and famales
- courses attracted more women
- a popular choice among both genders
- significantly more, higher, highest
- had the highest number, with (+ number)
- was taken by a mere 15 people
- According to the bar chart,
- Looking at the age profile pie chart,
- the majority of people
- were in the minority
- To be precise,

## Diagram - process

Describing a process is completely different from describing a graph, bar chart, pie chart or table

Differences:

- no numbers
- can't compare anything
- can't describe trends (increase, decrease)

So, what can we describe?

- how many steps
- where the process begins and ends
- each step in the process

Language for process descriptions:

- 'steps' language
- passive verbs

- At the first stage in the process
- The process begins with
- Secondly, Finally
- The second step involves
- Next, then, after that
- At the following stage

Question:

The diagrams below show how glass containers, such as bottles, are produced and recycled.

Writing:

The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second diagram shows steps in the process of recycling used glass.

We can see that glass is made using three main raw materials, and that the manufacturing process consist of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.

At the first stage in the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. Next, this mixture is heated in a glass furnace at approximately 1500℃ to produce molten glass. The molten glass can then be shaped, by blowing, to create the end products, namely glass containers.

Glass recycling begins with the collection of used glass products. The collected glass is sorted according to its colour, and then washed in order to remove any impurities. At the fourth stage of recycling, the glass is crushed and melted, and the resulting molten glass can finally be moulded to create new items.

Vocabulary:

- steps / stages in the process of
- consists of four distinct stages
- it requires five steps
- raw materials, end products
- production, manufacturing
- turn used glass into new products
- at the first stage, next, then, begins with
- are mixed, is heated, can be shaped
- is sorted according to
- can be moulded to create
- are mixed -> this mixture
- collection -> the collected glass
- is melted -> the resulting molten glass

## Diagram - comparing

Comparison diagrams show:

- changes to something e.g. an old design compard to a new design
- or two alternative designs
- or even two alternative locations on a map

Your job is to compare the diagrams:

- Describe the changes
- Describe things that don't change
- Describe the differences
- Describe the similarities

Important: Think about the verb tense that you'll use

Question:

The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.

Writing:

The two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.

We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.

The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current staircase and under-stair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.

To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.

Vocabulary:

- existing plan -> current layout
- proposed plan -> plan to redesign
- design proposal, planned building work
- there will no longer be
- this will be achieved by removing
- will also contain, will also include
- will be installed, will be replaced
- the design proposal involves
- when the building work has been done
- living space, central hall area, staircase
- under-stair storage cupboard
- a new set of winding stairs
- the installation of some kitchen furniture
