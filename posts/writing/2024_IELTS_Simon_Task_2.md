## Introductions

Method: 2 sentences

- introduce the topic
- give a general answer

A short introduction is better

2 sentences in 5 minutes (topic + answer)

### Four types of question

#### 1. Discussion

Question:

Some people think that it is more effective for students to study in groups, while others believe that it is better for them to study alone.  
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Plan:

Topic - study in groups or alone

Answer - somethimes better alone, usually better in a group

Writing:

People have different views about the effectiveness of group study as opposed to working alone. While there are some beenefits to studying independently, I believe that group work is usually more productive.

#### 2. Opinion

Question:

Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Plan:

Topic - community service for all teenagers

Answer - 3 choices: agree, disagree, or balanced opinion (when possible)

Writing:

It is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities. (agree: I completely agree that this kind of scheme would be a good idea.) (disagree: In my opinion, it would be wrong to force teenagers to do any kind of unsalaried work.) (balanced opinion: While I disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, I do believe that voluntary community service could benefit young people.)

#### 3. Problem and solution

Question:

Many criminals reoffend after they have been punished. Why do some people continue to commit crimes after they have been punished, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?

Plan:

Topic - criminals reoffend

Answer - several reasons, a variety of measures (governments, communities)

Writing:

It is true that punishments do not always deter criminals from committing more crimes. There are various reasons why offenders repeatedly break the law, but governments could certainly take steps to address this issue.

#### 4. Two-part question

Question:

As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual well-being. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?

Plan:

Topic - job satisfaction
Answer - several factors, unrealistic / impossible

Writing:

Work plays a central role in our lives, and we would all like to feel fulfilled professionally. While a variety of factors may lead to job satisfaction, it would be unrealistic to expect everyone to be happy at work.

## Main body paragraphs

4 paragraph essay

- 2 main body paragraphs
- 5 sentences in each
- 90 to 100 words each

How to write a main paragraph

2 types:

- Firstly, Secondly, Finally
  - advantages
  - disadvantages
  - problems
  - solutions
- Idea, Explain, Example
  - one idea
  - a reason
  - an opinion

### 1. Firstly, Secondly, Finally

Question:

Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

3-minute plan:

- disagree for several reasons
- school timetable is full, no time for community service
- students' work in other subjects would be affected
- teenagers might not want to do it (reluctant, no motivation)

Writing:

There are several reasons why I would argue against having compulsory community service for secondary school students. Firstly, the school curriculum is already full with important academic subjects, such as maths, science and languages. For example, I remember having an extremely busy timetable when I was at high school, and it would not have been possible to add to it. Secondly, students' performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken by charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes. Finally, I believe that teenage students would be reluctant to take part in any programme of obligatory work, and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour.

Try to write 5 sentences

1. Topic sentence
2. Firstly (5. explain more, or add example)
3. Secondly
4. Finally

### 2. Idea, Explain, Example

Question:

Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

3-minute plan:

- voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive
- students more motivated if they can choose
- gain work experience, self confidence, skills
- good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers

Writing:

On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be extremely positive for high school students. By making these programmes optional, schools would ensure that only motivated students took part. These young people would gain valuable experience in an adult working environment, which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills. Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve school leavers' career prospects. For example, a period of voluntary work experience might impress a university admissions officer or a future employer.

Try to write 5 sentences

- Idea
- Explain (2 or 3 sentences)
- Example

### Remember

- Linking words do **not** help your 'vocabulary' score

### Discussion (+ opinion)

Question:

In many cities the use of video cameras in public places is being increased in order to reduce crime, but some people believe that these measures restrict our individual freedom.

Do the beenefits of increased security outweigh the drawbacks?

Introduction:

It is true that video surveillance has become commonplace in many cities in recent years. While I understand that critics may see this as an invasion of privacy, I believe that there are more benefits than drawbacks.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, I would argue that the advantages of using video security systems in public places do outweigh the disadvantages.

### Opinion

Question:

Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Introduction:

Some people believe that parents of children who attend private schools should not need to contribute to state schools through taxes. Personally, I completely disagree with this view.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, I do not believe that any financial concessions should be made for people who choose private education.

### Problem and solution

Question:

In the developed world, average life expectancy is increasing.  
What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.

Introduction:

It is true that people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.

### 2-part question

Question:

There are many different types of music in the world today.  
Why do we need music? Is the traditional music of a country more important than the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays?

Introduction:

It is true that a rich variety of musical styles can be found around the world. Music is a vital part of all human cultures for a range of reasons, and I would argue that traditional music is more important than modern, international music.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, music is a necessary part of human existence, and I believe that traditional music should be given more importance than international music.

## Opinion essay

Do YOU agree or disagree?

You CAN use "I" or "my"

### Agree

Question:

The money spent by governments on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Planning:

1. Read and understand the question
   - highlight / underline key parts
2. Plan your essay structure (4 paragraphs)
   1. Introduction
      - Topic - government spending
      - Answer - agree, public services instead of space projects
   2. explain why 'space' spending should be stopped
   3. explain why public service spending is better
   4. Conclusion: spend on services that benefits us all
3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs
   - Why space spending should be stopped
     - expensive (scientists, facilities, equipment)
     - no benefit to normal people, politicians showing power
     - waste of money when projects fail, risk of accidents, deaths
     - e.g. Challenger space shuttle
   - Why public service spending is better
     - cheaper e.g. doctors, teachers police instead of astronauts
     - public services impact on everyone
     - we all use schools, hospitals, police, roads etc.
     - reduce poverty, better quality of life

Writing:

Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes. I completely agree with the idea that these are a waste of money, and that the funds should be allocated to public services.

There are several reasons why space programmes should be abandoned. Firstly, it is extremely expensive to train scientists and other staff involved with space missions, and facilities and equipment also come at a huge cost to the government. Secondly, these programmes do not benefit normal people in our daily lives; they are simply vanity projects for politicians. Finally, many missions to space fail completely, and the smallest technological error can cost astronauts their lives. The Challenger space shuttle disaster showed us that space travel is extremely dangerous, and in my opinion it is not worth the risk.

I believe that the money from space programmes should go to vital public services instead. It is much cheaper to train doctors, teachers, police and other public service workers than it is to train astronauts or the scientists and engineers who work on space wxploration projects. Furthermore, public servants do jobs that have a positive impact on every member of society. For example, we all use schools, hospitals and roads, and we all need the security that the police provide. If governments reallocated the money spent on space travel and research, many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty or given a better quality of life.

In conclusion, my view is that governments should spend money on services that benefit all members of society, and it is wrong to waste resources on projects that do not improve our everyday lives.

Vocabulary:

- space programmes, exploration, missions, projects, travel, research
- funds should be allocated
- should be abandoned
- facilities and equipment come at a huge cost
- vanity projects for politicians
- can cost astronauts their lives
- space shuttle disaster
- public servants
- a positive impact on every member of society
- if governments reallocated
- could be lifted out of poverty
- given a better quality of life

### Disagree

Question:

Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Writing:

1. Introduction: Some hobbies are relatively easy, while others present more of a challenge. Personally, I believe that both types of hobby can be fun, and I therefore disagree with the statement that hobbies need to be difficult in order to be enjoyable.
2. explain why easy hobbies can be enjoyable
3. explain why difficult hobbies can be fun
4. Conclusion: disagree that difficult hobbies are better

### Partly agree

Question:

Many people say that we now live in 'consumer societies' where money and possessions are given too much importance.  
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Writing:

1. Introduction: It is true that many people criticise modern society because it seems to be too materialistic. I agree with this to some extent, but I do not think it is the case that everyone is a victim of consumer culture.
2. I believe many people do focus too much on money
3. However, many others are not money oriented
4. Conclusion: partly agree

Writing:

1. Introduction: It is often argued that the act of sending a man to the moon has been of no benefit to normal people. While I agree that this is true in practical terms, I believe that the psychological impact of this great achievement should not be underestimated.
2. no benefit in practical terms (standard of living, health)
3. but it was an ispiring achievement
4. Conclusion: partly agree

## Discussion essay

Question:

Some peoplethink that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.  
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

Planning:

1. Read and understand the question
   - highlight /underline key parts
2. Plan your essay structure
   1. Introduction
      - Topic: competition or co-operation?
      - Answer: benefits of both, co-operation more important
   2. Why encourage competition
   3. Why teach co-operation (my view)
   4. Conclusion: accept both views, co-operation better
3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs
   - Why encourage competition
     - motivation to work harder
     - be better than other children
     - self confidence, independent work, faster progress
     - competitive situations when leave school e.g. job interviews
     - prepared for adult life
   - Why teach co-operation (my view)
     - co-operation even more important
     - e.g. at work (teams, follow boss's instructions, help junior staff)
     - collaboration more useful than winning
     - better attitude for young people
     - working together

Writing:

People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative. While a spirit of competition can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important.

On the one hand, competition can be a great source of motivation for children. When teachers use games or prizes to introduce an element of competitiveness into lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to outdo the other pupils in the class. This kind of healthy rivalry may help to build children's self confidence, while pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly. When these children leave school, their confidence and determination will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.

On the other hand, it is perhaps even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation. In the workplace, adults are expected to work in teams, follow instructions given by their superiors, or supervise and support the more junior members of staff. Team collaboration skills are much more useful than a competitive determination to win. This is the attitude that I believe schools should foster in young people. Instead of promoting the idea that people are either winners or losers, teachers could show children that they gain more from working together.

In conclusion, I can understand why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children, but it seems to me that a co-operative attitude is much moredesirable in adult life.

Vocabulary:

- competition / co-operation. competitive, co-operative, co-operate, competitiveness
- a spirit of competition
- a source of motivation
- introduce an element of competitiveness
- outdo other pupils, healthy rivalry
- build self confidence, determination
- aspects of adult life
- superiors, junior members of staff
- team collaboration skills
- attitude that schools should foster
- promoting the idea
- a co-operative attitude is more desirable

## Problem and solution essay

Question:

In many countries schools have severe problems with students behaviour.  
What do you think are the causes of this?  
What solutions can you suggest?

Planning:

1. Read and understand the question
   - highlight / underline key parts
2. Plan your essay structure
   1. Introduction
      - Topic: student behaviour in schools
      - Answer: variety of reasons, steps can be taken to tackle
   2. Causes of bad student behaviour
   3. My suggested solutions
   4. Conclusion: summarise the problem and steps
3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs
   - Causes of bad student behaviour
     - parents not strict (too lenient)
     - children don't accept teachers' instructions or school rules
     - teachers' fault, no control, bad classroom management
     - influence of celebrities who are a bad example
   - My suggested solutions
     - parents set rules for children
     - use punishments, actions have consequences
     - schools train teachers and parents, discipline techniques, better communication
     - famous people act as role models

Writing:

It is true that the behaviour of school pupils in some parts of the world has been getting worse in recent years. There are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem.

In my opinion, three main factors are to blame for the way young people behave at school nowadays. Firstly, modern parents tend to be too lenient or permissive. Many children become accustomed to getting whatever they want, and they find it difficult to accept the demands of teachers or the limits imposed on them by school rules. Secondly, if teachers cannot control their students, there must be an issue with the quality of classroom management training or support within schools. Finally, children are influenced by the behaviour of celebrities, many of whom set the example that success can be achieved without finishing school.

Student behaviour can certainly be improved. I believe that the change must start with parents, who need to be persuaded that it is important to set firm rules for their children. When children misbehave or break the rules, parents should use reasonable punishments to demonstrate that actions have consequences. Also, schools could play an important role in training both teachers and parents to use effective disciplinary techniques, and in improving the communication between both groups. At the same time, famous people, such as musicians and football players, need to understand the responsibility that they have to act as role models to children.

In conclusion, schools will continue to face discipline problems unless parents, teachers and public figures set clear rules and demonstrate the right behaviour themselves.

Vocabulary:

- steps can be taken to tackle the problem
- three main factors are to blame
- parents tend to be too lenient or permissive
- children become accustomed to
- limits imposed on them
- quality of classroom management
- celebrities, famous people, public figures
- set an example
- set firm rules, reasonable punishments
- play an important role in
- effective disciplinary techniques
- responsibility to act as role models
- face discipline problems

## Two-part question

Question:

News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. What factors do you think influence these decisions? Do we become used to bad news, and would it be better if more good news was reported?

Planning:

1. Read and understand the question
   - highlight / underline key parts
2. Plan your essay structure
   1. Introduction
      - Topic: decisions about news stories
      - Answer: variety of factors, yes too much bad news
   2. Factors that influence news editors
   3. Too much bad news, should report more good
   4. Conclusion: difficult news choices, more positive
3. Plan ideas for the two main paragraphs
   - Factors that influence news editors
     - interest or attract viewers / readers
     - inform the public, important issues and events, in the public interest
     - pressure from owners, promote political views
   - Too much bad news, should report more good
     - accustomed to bad news
     - war, crime, natural disasters, human suffering
     - desensitises us, cynical about the world
     - prefer positive news, e.g. medical workers, volunteers, kindness
     - news to inspire us

Writing:

It is true that editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories they broadcast or publish, and their choices are no doubt influenced by a variety of factors. In my opinion, we are exposed to too much bad news, and I would welcome a greater emphasis on good news.

Editors face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on. Firstly, I imagine that they have to consider whether viewers or readers will be interested enough to choose their television channel or their newspaper over competing providers. Secondly, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore prioritise stories that are in the public interest. Finally, editors are probably under some pressure from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have particular political views that he or she wants to promote.

It seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news. We are exposed on a daily basis to stories about war, crime, natural disasters and tragic human suffering around the world. I believe that such repeated exposure gradually desensitises people, and we become more cynical about the world and more sceptical that we can do anything to change it. I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natrual disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.

In conclusion, it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see a more positive approach to this vital public service.

Vocabulary:

- exposed to bad news
- welcome a greater emphasis on good news
- Editors face a range of considerations
- prioritise stories that are in the public interest
- under some pressure from the owners
- promote particular political views
- become accustomed to negative news
- natural disasters and tragic human suffering
- exposure gradually desensitises people
- cynical and sceptical
- inspire us all to lead better lives
