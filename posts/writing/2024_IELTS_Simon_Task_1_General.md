# General Writing Task 1

Letter writing task (20 minutes, 150 words or more)

7 steps:

1. Read the task and highlight key things
2. Choose the 'tone': formal, informal, not sure (e.g. manager, friend, neighbour)
3. Choose an appropriate greeting and ending
4. Decide on the overall purpose of the letter
5. Decide on the paragraph structure
6. Know the aim of each paragraph e.g. thanking, explaining, complaining
7. Think of an idea for each point

Students' questions:

1. What are the differences between formal and informal letters?  
   Details in next lesson
2. Will it affect my score if I make mistakes with formal and informal language?  
   Yes, of course.
3. What about "semi-formal" letters?  
   In some cases you can choose.
4. Should we avoid pronouns like "I" or "we" in letters?  
   No, you should not avoid them.
5. Should we start the letter with an address and date? Should we sign the letter at the end?  
   The answer to both of those questions is No.
6. What verb tense should we use in most letters?  
   That depends on the questions.
7. Can we include questions in our letters?  
   Yes we can.
8. How are letters marked by the examiner?
   - Task achievement (25%): purpose, tone, answer all points
   - Coherence and cohesion (25%): clear paragraphs, flow of ideas, linking
   - Vocabulary (25%): appropriate, "less common"
   - Grammar (25%): long and short sentences, avoid mistakes

Please note:

Memorised phrases are not the secret to a high score in IELTS writing.

The phrases in this lesson are useful, but you will also need to use good 'topic vocabulary'.

For example, if you are writing a 'complaining' letter, the topic vocabulary will depend on the problem that you are complaining about e.g. a bad meal in a restaurant, a train that was late, or a problem with something you bought in a shop.

Topic vocabulary is much harder to prepare because we can't predict every possible topic that might appear in the test. To improve your knowledge of topic vocabulary, you need to read lots of example letters and do lots of practice!

## Formal letters

Question:

You recently organised a party for your company at a hotel.

Write a letter to the hotel manager. In your letter

- describe the party and how it went
- explain why you were pleased with the hotel's service
- suggest some improvements that the hotel could make

Planning:

1. Read and highlight
2. Choose the 'tone': formal
3. Greeting and ending: Dear sir or Madam, Yours faithfullly
4. Purpose: I am writing with regard to the party that...
5. Paragraphs: purpose, three points, final sentence (five separate paragraphs)
6. Paragraph aims
7. Ideas
   - company's 20-year anniversary, thoroughly enjoyable
   - staff were welcoming and attentive
   - decorations, signs to find the room (improved signage)

Writing:

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing with regard to the party that my company held at your hotel last weekend.

The event commemorated our company's 20th anniversary, and all two hundred staff members from across the country were invited. I am pleased to say that everything went according to plan and it was a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable evening.

We were particularly impressed by the hotel personnel on the night, including waiters, bar staff and members of the events team. They were friendly, welcoming and attentive, and they ensured that the party ran smoothly.

Perhaps I could make one or two suggestions for future events. First, a little more care could have been taken with decorations in the events room; for example, it would have been nice to see more balloons. Second, a few people struggled to find the events room when they arrived, so you might consider improving your sinage in the hotel.

On behalf of all of my colleagues, I would like to thank you and your team for hosting such a special event.

Yours faithfully,
John Smith

Dear James,

I hope you're well. I'm afraid I have a bit of bad news related to our plan to meet next Friday evening.

I was really looking forward to catching up with you, but unfortunately something has come up and I'm not going to be able to make it. I'm really sorry to have to cancel, especially as we haven't had a proper chat for such a long time.

So, what's my excuse? Well, my boss has just informed me that I'm going to be speaking at a conference in London that runs from Wednesday to Friday. I thought I might be able to rush back on the Friday afternoon, but apparently we're being treated to an evening meal in the hotel, and I'm expected to attend.

On a more positive note, it's my birthday the following Saturday, and I'm planning to have a small celebration with family and close friends. I'll be cooking a meal at my place, and you're more than welcome to come along.

Sorry about next Friday, but I hope to see you at my birthday party!

Best regards,
John

## Semi-formal letters?

My advice:

Forget the idea of "semi-formal" letters

Either write a formal letter or an informal letter

If we forget about "semi-formal", the only question is:

How do we know when to write a formal letter and when to write an informal letter?

Answer: look at 3 things

1. Instructions below the task
   - Begin your letter as follows: Dear Sir or Madam, => Formal
   - Begin your letter as follows: Dear......, => step 2
2. The person you are writing to
   - | The person you are writing to | Type     |
     | ----------------------------- | -------- |
     | a friend or family member     | informal |
     | a person you do not know      | formal   |
     | work colleague                | ?        |
     | boss                          | ?        |
     | neighbour                     | ?        |
     | teacher                       | ?        |
3. The purpose of the letter
   - friendly / social => informal
   - professional / business => formal
