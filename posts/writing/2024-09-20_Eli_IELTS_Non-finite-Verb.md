# 非谓语动词 + 外刊句式积累

## 非谓语动词

非谓语动词，本质上一般是作定语，例如最常见的英语句型：主语 + 定语（形容词、定语从句、同位语、介词短语、非谓语） + 谓语 + 宾语.

1. 后置非谓语：主语 + 谓语 + 宾语, 非谓语 + 宾语.

   There are many spectators watching the show, meaning/suggesting that Chinese cultures are becoming more and more popular.

   watching the show 非谓语 作 spectators 的定语

   meaning/suggesting that 非谓语 + 宾语从句

   1. 必须快速反应出只有在这句话已经有了谓语（主谓宾）的情况下，才会出现非谓语

   2. 非谓语动词也是动词，但凡是动词你就要去想谁发出的动词

      - 没有逗号，动词发出者通常为前面的名词

        I like this book making me happy

        例外：主句谓语是不及物动词，可能由主句主语或整个主句发出。（这种情况较少见）

        This is happening making us happy.

      - 有逗号的，需要根据上下文判断谁发出的动词，可能是前一句的主语、宾语或整个句子。

        My teacher in this school will do a presentation, involving some topics. 宾语 presentation 发出 involving

        My teacher in this school will do a presentation, feeling happy. 主语 teacher 发出 feeling

        My teacher in this school will do a presentation, making us proud. 整个主句发出 making

        I like to use computers, bought by my dad. 宾语

        I like to read books, writing some notes. 主语

        I like this book, making me happy. 宾语

        I like to do exercises, making me happy. 整句

2. 前置非谓语：非谓语(Doing/Done) + 宾语, 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语.

   1. 前置非谓语通常由主句的主语发出

      Reading this book, my teacher is happy.

   2. 前置非谓语通常分句与主句有顺序关系，分句先发生，主句后发生

      Having scored 99, he is very happy now.

      Looking from a broad perspective, we can see a trend. 整句

3. 句中非谓语：主语, 定语（非谓语）, 谓语 + 宾语.

   这种句型通常只是修饰主语，没有明显顺序关系

   My teacher, almost overwhelmed by her projects, will have some time to do something.

   This player, liked by us, will come to my school today.

4. 非谓语动词不及物时，上面 3 个句型中紧跟着非谓语动词的宾语都不存在，可能是一个状语。

   Quickly happening (when you are at school), this situation is good.

### 常见错误

1. Using this computer to type words, I am learning this computer.

   语法上没有错误，但表意上缺少逻辑。应该是先学电脑，再来使用。

   改正：Learning this computer, I am using this computer to type words.

2. Learning this culture, there are more chances for us to be happy.

   非谓语也是动词，要找动词的主语，主句中没有主语能够发出 learning 这个动词。

## 题目

It is common aspiration among many young people to run their own business, rather than work for an employer.

Do you think the advantages of working for yourself outweigh the drawbacks?

好处：自己挣钱；时间自由；做喜欢的事
坏处：投资风险；不稳定；心态；没有经验

Among the topics that are heatedly debated by a lot of people in our society is whether to work for themselves or for an employer for the younger generation. Running their own business, aspired by countless young people nowadays, certainly boasts many benefits for them. For anyone who may doubt the advantages of being an entrepreneur, however, the following reasons could provide strong evidence that this behavior is full of risks.

First, if your business skills and experience are in unmature level, starting up your own business could be full of financial risks, particularly when you spend your own money to create your company. Especially the story where a start-up company has gained a large sum of profits in a wonderful economic environment may end differently when there is a financial downturn in our society. Second, lacking necessary experience in business and stable mindsets for being a boss, some young adults as a novel entrepreneur could face much mental pressure from all kinds of obstacles in running their own business. As to what a confused/perplexing and exhausted mindset in management could result in, many wrong and regrettable decisions may be on the way in the future, which could seriously affect a company's performance.
