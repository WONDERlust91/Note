# 状语从句

## 定义

一个句子等于是一个副词

副词：修饰动词；形容词；介词

因此状语从句也只有这三个功能

## 规则

只有一个关系连词引导

If/when/where/although/though/while/because/as(when/while/because)

## 修饰动词

If 分句, 主语 谓语 宾语

If 分句 修饰 谓语

I can beat you, if you are happy. = If you are happy, I can beat you.

I like this game played by him when he is happy. 没有逗号时，状语从句修饰的动词遵循就近原则，因此修饰非谓语动词 played

I like this game played by him, when I am happy. 有逗号且根据句意，状语从句修饰主句动词：like

## 修饰形容词

There is a book useful and important for me when I am learning sth..

## 修饰介词（不太常见）
